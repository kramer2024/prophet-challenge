**Question:** Do both time series indicate a common trend thatâ€™s consistent with this narrative?

**Answer:** In truth, our evidence of a common trend between search activity and stock price is pretty limited. It does appear generally however that the low point for Mercado Libre's stock price, late March to early April, did coincide with lower search activity for the firm. Search activity does pick up along with its stock price, although the stock price from mid-April onward definitively outpaces search interest.

There's one important thing to note: if you zoom in both graphs to the spike around May 5th, 2020, you'll find the date of the company's earnings release to the public. It looks like search traffic for the firm spiked about two hours before the firm's stock price spiked. This could indicate a predictable pattern (can Google Searches predict the stock price?), but an alternative explanation might just be that people tend to search for more information about the firm right before an earnings announcement gets released. We'd need to do a little more time-series research to see which explanation best fits the data.

**Question:** Does a predictable relationship exist between the lagged search traffic and the stock volatility or between the lagged search traffic and the stock price returns?

**Answer:** If we read down the second column (or read along the second row), we see that there's a slight negative correlation between searches for the firm and its subsequent stock volatility. More searches (slightly) tend to indicate less near-term hourly stock risk for the firm.

On the other hand, there's a positive correlation between search activity in one hour and stock returns in the next: as search activity goes up, so will the firm's stock price in the short term. This effect is very weak though, only half the size of the effect on stock volatility. With the correlation so close to zero, some might also say that there's almost no relationship between these two variables whatsoever, and that the small findings that we do have could be just due to chance. While there's no required threshold when looking at correlation between stock returns and the variables used to predict them, it does tend to be that correlations in this context tend to be very low across the board. It's hard to predict the market!
